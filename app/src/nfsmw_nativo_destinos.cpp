// nfsmw - native renderer, part C2 (see nfsmw_nativo_destinos.h).
//
// WHAT IT COVERS
//   - k_8_8_8_8 and k_8_8_8_8_GAMMA color render targets without MSAA, as
//     R8G8B8A8 images of pitch x max(720, pitch) (capped at 2048).
//   - Copy of a rectangle of the render target to the resolved texture at
//     RB_COPY_DEST_BASE (destination format k_8_8_8_8), with the rectangle and
//     the base computed like GetResolveInfo (graphics/util/draw.cpp:765-1010).
//   - Render targets with MSAA: used with 1 sample (MSAA hangs NVK on the Switch).
//   - Color clear with RB_COLOR_CLEAR, converted like the emulation does
//     (vulkan/render_target_cache.cpp:5350-5355).
//   - Presentation: the resolved texture requested by fetch constant 0 of the
//     Swap is drawn into the presenter output with the SDK's own shaders. By
//     default, with the gamma ramp the game loads, like the Xbox 360 display
//     (shaders/nfsmw_salida_rampa_gamma.frag).
//
// DRAWS (parts C3-C6, nfsmw_nativo_dibujos.cpp)
//   This class lends them the render targets (color and depth), the frame's
//   command buffer and an upload one that is submitted right before it.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER
//   Copies from depth, 16- and 32-bit formats, 3D textures as destination,
//   clearing only the rectangle (the whole image is cleared) and the normal
//   draws (parts C3-C6, in nfsmw_nativo_dibujos.cpp).
//
// Everything is used only by the native system's PM4 ring thread: no locks.

/*
 * Swap the color too, not only the depth.
 *
 * Image swapping (resolving without copying) works for depth and is worth 2.36 ms measured. For color it
 * never could, not because of the mechanism but because of a silly size detail: the color render target is
 * created with `height = max(720, pitch)`, so with pitch 1280 it is 1280x1280, while the resolved texture is
 * 1280x720. Since IntercambiarConResuelta requires the same size, it always said no.
 *
 * The idea: the game never draws below row 720 in a color render target (the viewport and the scissor are
 * 1280x720 in every draw measured), so the pitch-1280 color render target was created 720 high and both
 * sizes matched.
 *
 * That is 4 copies of 1280x720 per frame = 3.69 Mpixels, 78 % of all copy traffic.
 *
 * Result (tested): it does not work, for two separate reasons.
 *   1. Without requiring a clear: 16,807 color swaps and 17,350 restores, almost one for one. The game
 *      draws on top again without clearing, so the copy is paid anyway, later and with two operations
 *      instead of one.
 *   2. Requiring a clear and creating the render target 720 high: the scene breaks (the screen fills with
 *      a yellow smear). The color render target cannot be shrunk to 720.
 * It stays off. The code is kept because the mechanism is correct; what fails is that this game reuses the
 * color render target without clearing it.
 *
 * The safety net is mandatory and did not exist for color: DestinoColor did not call RestaurarContenido
 * (DestinoProfundidad did). Without it, the first frame in which the game draws on top without clearing
 * would see the previous frame's content. It is added here.

 * The flickering shadows of the main menu. This was the cause.

 * A resolve without a clear that is done by swapping leaves the content in the texture and the render target
 * with that texture's old image (contenido_invalido). It was only brought back when drawing on top
 * (DestinoProfundidad) and never before another resolve, which read the old image as it was.
 *
 * In a race it does not happen: between the two resolves of the shadow map the cars are drawn and that
 * brings it back. In the menu it does, every frame. The garage draws the car into the 1600x1600 map and
 * resolves twice in a row, without drawing in between: without a clear to 07CEA000 (read by the car body) and
 * with a clear to 086AE000 (read by the scenery). On the console, in the menu: 398 swaps without a clear + 398
 * with a clear and 0 restores in 10 s. With images A, B and C:
 *     draw into A -> resolve to 07CEA000: the texture keeps A (correct), the render target gets B (the old one)
 *                 -> resolve to 086AE000: the texture keeps B: the previous frame's map
 * The scenery always sampled the map from one frame earlier with the current frame's light matrix. While the
 * shadow framing does not change, it is not noticeable. As soon as it jumps (the menu camera comes in
 * rotating) the old map lands shifted and the wall to the right of the car goes dark for one frame: a
 * console capture shows it every ~4 game frames between seconds 8 and 9.
 *
 * Now, if the render target about to be resolved has its content in another texture, it is first brought
 * back by copying (without lending or the minimum trick: this is a resolve, not the car pass), and the
 * resolve continues as usual. It is the exact path: on the Xbox 360 both resolves read the same EDRAM. It
 * costs one 1600x1600 copy per frame in the menu (~1.5 ms of GPU); in a race nothing is touched because the

 * has to be brought back before the cars: that is the 1600x1600 copy (2.56 Mpixels, ~1.5 ms real per frame,
 * the most expensive copy in the frame).
 *
 * With this setting the render target is cleared to 1.0 instead of copied and the cars are drawn alone.
 * texture[0] ends up with the cars only, and the draws that sample it through their SHADOWMAP_SAMPLER
 * (tfetch2DSombraMin in the library) get min(texture[0], texture[1]): the 3D index word of that register
 * carries texture[1] and the pipeline carries the SPEC_CONSTANT_SOMBRA_MINIMO bit (23). This is exact, not
 * an approximation: with Z writes and a LESS or LEQUAL test, what a draw leaves on a buffer is the minimum
 * of what was there and of its fragments, and min(world, min(1, cars)) = min(world, cars) because no texel
 * exceeds 1.0. The map is point-sampled and both views carry the same swizzle: the result is the same value
 * the copy would have left. The depth bias is the same on both paths (same pipelines). With the cheap PCF
 * there is one extra read per fragment that samples the world shadow; with the 9-sample PCF it would be nine
 * and it does not pay off: without nfsmw_nativo_pcf_barato it copies as always.
 *
 * It costs a clear of 2.56 Mpixels (~0.19 ms at 0.075 ms per Mpixel) and that read; it saves the copy
 * (~1.54 ms).
 *
 * GUARD, self-checking:
 *   - WATCHING: it copies as always and watches the whole cycle (resolve without a clear by swapping, car pass
 *     on the same render target, resolve with a clear by swapping), that every draw of the car pass is exact
 *     (pass without color, without stencil, without an occlusion query and, if it writes Z, a NEVER, LESS or
 *     LEQUAL test) and that every read of texture[0] comes from a shader with tfetch2DSombraMin in that
 *     register and outside the window between the two resolves. Those reads already use the pipeline with
 *     the bit (minimum with itself: the same texel), so switching to applying does not create pipelines in
 *     the middle of a race. After kSombraMinimoCiclos clean cycles in a row it moves to
 *   - APPLYING: clears instead of copying. If anything watched fails, DIFERENCIA in the log (REXLOG_ERROR) and
 *   - OFF for the session: it copies again. A library without tfetch2DSombraMin never leaves watching.
 * Report line: "C2 sombra por minimo". false = always copy, as before.

 *
 * The cause: the work slots and the output slots are two different things and only one is configurable.
 *
 *     work slots   (nfsmw_nativo_ranuras_trabajo):  3 -> 4
 *     output slots (kRanurasSalida, :486):          3   FIXED
 *
 * `kRanurasSalida` governs the quad that draws the game image on screen: its pools, its descriptors, its
 * fences (`fences_salida_`) and `salidas_pendientes_`, and the rotation at :3305 is `% kRanurasSalida`.
 * Letting the CPU get three frames ahead in the work reuses an output slot whose image is still being
 * displayed. Hence the artifacts.
 *
 * To raise it, kRanurasSalida must be raised at the same time and the four places above reviewed.
 * Changing only this number is not enough.
 *
 * -------- what was believed before, kept so that it is not repeated --------
 * Four, and this time on its own.
 *
 * It first went in together with the sky deferral and the lazy sealing. That build broke the image and all
 * three were reverted without knowing which one it was; then the sky counter showed the culprit was the
 * sky ("7,00 detectados por fotograma" when 0.9 was expected). So this one comes back on its own, which
 * is how it should have been added from the start.
 *
 * What it buys, measured per regime:
 *   few draws (straight):    GPU 31.37 ms | gap 2.05 | waiting for the fence in Grabar() 4.9-9.8 ms
 *   many draws (alley):      GPU 30.30 ms | gap 5.50 | waiting for the fence ~0
 *
 * On the straight the CPU arrives first and stalls waiting for the GPU to release the slot. With four it is
 * three frames ahead. It costs 64 MB of upload buffer, out of the ~900 MB free in the heap.

    // TRANSFER_DST is dropped from the scene depth, which is 50 % of the frame, and kept for the shadow

    // never swaps with its resolved texture (console logs: thousands of "sin intercambio ... porque la
    // orden no borra el destino", 0 restores). The shadow map does swap, ~0.83 times per frame, and that

    // 1. It still needs it. The reasoning was that the map is no longer copied but swapped, so the flag
    //    would be unnecessary. Wrong: each swap is paid for with a restore, and a restore is exactly a
    //    copy into this image (RestaurarContenido -> copiar_imagen_ with destino.imagen as dst, which
    //    requires TRANSFER_DST). Steady race, three consecutive 10 s intervals:
    //        swaps without clear  4679 -> 4885 -> 5145 -> 5369   (+206, +260, +224)

    //    Exactly one restore per swap. The 1600x1600 copy did not go away: it is paid later, in
    //    DestinoProfundidad. Without TRANSFER_DST that is an illegal write.
    //    Also, IntercambiarConResuelta requires admite_destino_de_copia, so removing the flag would also
    //    disable the 2 swaps per frame that do pay off.
    //
    // 2. Even if it were possible, it would not help. Fit over 17 race intervals with a constant open

     * opened), and the per-draw ones are only used one frame every 20 seconds.

     * The reset comes before the first MarcarGpu, so its cost does not show up in any category of the
     * breakdown: it is swallowed by the "hueco entre trabajos" (gap between submissions). Estimated at
     * 0.3-1.1 real ms per frame; the measured upper bound (the minimum gap over a whole session) is
